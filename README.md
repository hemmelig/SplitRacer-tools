Requirements

You should also add the custom matplotlib stylesheets (ending with '*.mplstyle*') to your matplotlib config directory. This is usually found at ~/.config/matplotlib/stylelib (note: you made need to create the stylelib directory).

It is also recommended you download and add the Helvetica font (in .ttf format) to your matplotlib fonts collection, usually found somewhere like ~/anaconda/envs/<ENVIRONMENT>/lib/python3.x/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf
